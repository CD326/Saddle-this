# Saddle-this

This is a blog app about interior design focusing on Contemporary Rustic Mountain House and adding eclectic styles. Putting it all together, the end product is a home that feels well balanced. There's sense of harmony in the midst of imperfection. It is based on a personal experience after purchasing, decorating and designing our own home. Using a full-stack site hosted by Heroku, the user can browse the site for design inspiration, take a Personality Design Style Quiz and test out their design skills in Color & React. There are other features included such as Google sign-in and maps, Facebook likes and comments form and a contact form to send me a message.
