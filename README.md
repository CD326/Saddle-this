* Thanks to anyone's code that was used as inspiration.

* Many thanks to Dennis Molloy without him I could not have finished this project, and Thomas Rizzo for helping me deploy the site to Heroku. Finally, I want to thank Sarah Cullen for teaching me how to code. I'm humbled and grateful to have had this opportunity to take the class under her direction.
