# Saddle-this

This is an interior design lifestyle blog for a rustic contemporary mountain house. Using a full-stack site hosted by Heroku, the user can browse the site to take inspiration from my own personal designs, take a Personality Design Style Quiz and test their design skills in Color & React.

## Acknowledgments

* Thanks to anyone's code that was used as inspiration.

* Many thanks to Dennis Molloy without him I could not have finished this project, and Thomas Rizzo for helping me deploy the site to Heroku. Finally, I want to thank Sarah Cullen for teaching me how to code. I'm humbled and grateful to have had this opportunity to take the class under her direction.
